Installed [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) for MacOS by following:
- https://dev.to/dafloresdiaz/neovim-for-macos-3nk0

Plugins are managed with [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).

Could not use NeoVim color schemes while using Oh-my-zsh:

Ended up switching to iTerm2 on MacOS and installing custom color scheme there:
